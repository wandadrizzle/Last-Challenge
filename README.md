It has come to my attention that though I am coding almost daily, but either using Replit on my VS Code editor and not pushing said code to my GitHub is not on. Editing a read-me, and perhaps in my case JUST updating my journal is frowned upon. A github streak should be preserved with more than that.

Anyway, this was the last challenge I did as part of my [SoloLearn Intermediate C#](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/c-sharp-intermediate) course. I completed it work using [Microsoft's .NET Learn docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2?view=net-8.0). I'm really trying to not lean on ChatGPT that much, so I'm proud of me.
